 *
 * \brief  The XMEGA Quadrature Decoder driver header file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes and enumerator definitions
 *      for various configuration parameters for the XMEGA Quadrature Decoder.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code. The
 *      driver is intended for rapid prototyping and documentation purposes for
 *      getting started with the XMEGA Quadrature Decoder.
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1600: Using the XMEGA Quadrature Decoder
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
